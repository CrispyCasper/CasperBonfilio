		Although I dont have much work experience, I believe I would be an excellent canidate for a job because of my ability
		    to overcome challenging issues. I am good at following directions given by others, but I'm not afraid to take the
		    lead when necessary. I'm a team player and a strive for an equal divide of work loads, rather than a multiple person
		    project being handled mostly by one person in thr group. My experences battling cancer and depression has made me a
		    hard worker in regards to my passions and school work because there have been points in my life where I was unsure
		    if I would reach tomorrow. That mindset as taught me to work as hard as I can in the now, rather than putting things
		    off because you can accomplish so much in small time periods throughout your life. I try to take these small
		    opportunities as much as possible.
